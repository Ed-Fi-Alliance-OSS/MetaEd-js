Atom-MetaEd
======

Purpose
-

This is the MetaEd plugin for the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor.  It is the source of the _atom-metaed_ package deployed in the Ed-Fi npm registry.  When installed as a plugin for Atom, it is known as the _MetaEd IDE_.  Versioning of _atom-metaed_ follows the versioning of MetaEd IDE releases, differing only in patch version.

Atom-Metaed handles all of the interfacing to the Atom editor, delegating syntax and semantic validation to _metaed-core_.  Actual MetaEd generation is also performed by _metaed-core_.
