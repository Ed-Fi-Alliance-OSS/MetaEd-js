# metaed-js

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/MetaEd-js/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/MetaEd-js)

MetaEd is:

* a [domain-specific language](./docs/metaed-as-language.md) (DSL) for documenting data models;
* a file extension (`.metaed`);
* and an IDE for working with those files (via Visual Studio Code).

This repository contains the core code for the DSL and transformation logic that turns the data model files into other useful
artifacts, such as SQL scripts and model files used to generate an API application.

A curious explorer may stumble on several archived code repositories containing the original C# IDE and its replacement Atom
integration. The VS Code solution is the only one used and supported starting from spring, 2023.

See [docs](./docs) for more developer documents.
